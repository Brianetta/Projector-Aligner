Projector Aligner
-----------------

All configuration is done through Custom Data. Simply create a heading
in the custom data of any block that you wish to use with this script:

[projector]

You may add cockpits, flight seats, remote controls and projectors.
By default all blocks will be in the "default" projector group. You can
change this by specifying a group name. For example:

[projector]
group=Ship Printer

To make use of a display, specify a display number and (optionally) a
scale and a color. For example:

[projector]
display=0
scale=0.5
color=00CED1

Change the number to the screen that you wish to use; numbers start at 0, so a
five-screen cockpit has screens 0, 1, 2, 3 and 4.
Color should be entered as six hexadecimal digits representing red, green and blue.
